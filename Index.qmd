# Imarika Discipleship: Scripture Memory and Meditation

## Preface

These notes are from the second session of the *Imarika Discipleship Class*, a series designed to ground believers in foundational spiritual practices. "Imarika" (Swahili for "be firm" or "stand strong") reflects the goal of this class: to strengthen faith through intentional engagement with God's Word.

In this session, we focus on **Scripture Memory and Meditation**, exploring:
    - Why Scripture Memory
    - Is it necessary?
    - How to memorise scripture?
    - Meditation
    - How to Meditate on scripture.


These teachings, delivered by *Brian Kamara* on *12th April 2025*, a call to actionâ€”to internalize and live out the truths of Scripture.
